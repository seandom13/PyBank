# PyBank

In this project, I wrote a Python script to perform a budget analysis. 

Below are the calculations performed in the analysis:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
In addition I exported the results to a text(.txt) file.
